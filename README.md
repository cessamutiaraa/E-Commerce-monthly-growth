From the above graph of profit to cost ratio from 2019 - 2022, the product category that had the lowest ratio was Clothing Sets. And the highest ratio was Blazers & Jackets. We could say that Blazer & Jackets had a better return of investment compared to the rest categories.

## Insight & Recommendation
The profit to cost ratio of each product category shows the total profit compared with the total cost as well as the return of investment, and indirectly indicates the customer’s consumption pattern. And the Avg TPV and Avg TPO showed the downward trend for the last 3.5 years,
From the analysis, TheLook eCommerce needs to evaluate the product category that they sell in their marketplace to match their customer’s consumption pattern and boost their TPV and TPO, so does the profit.
